class SpotAnalysis(Iterator[tuple[SpotAnalysisOperable]]):
    """Spot Analysis class for characterizing beams of light.

    This is meant to be a general beam characterization tool that receives as
    input an image (or video) of a single beam, and generates annotations and
    numerical statistics as output. In general, there is an image processing
    step, an image analysis step, and a visualization step. Any number of
    processors and analyzers can be chained together to form a pipeline for
    evaluation. Once defined, a SpotAnalysis instance can be used to evaluate
    one image/video per evaluation.

    A list of possible use cases for this class include::

        1. BCS
        2. BCS-based heliostat calibration
        3. Vertical laser characterization
        4. Laser beam spread characterization
        5. 2f returned spot analysis
        6. Motion characterization video analysis
        7. Wind BCS video trajectory analysis
        8. Laser-based cross-check
        9. Earth mover's metric for comparisons (scipy has a method, also maaaaaybe look at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/rubner-jcviu-00.pdf)
        10. Enclosed power

    These are our expected outputs::

        - Annotated images
        - Visualizations (ex 2d or 3d heat-flux map, side-by-side comparisons)
        - Accompanying statistics INI files
        - Other details text file (heliostat name and location, date and time, heliostat operator, etc...)
        - Powerpoint slides
