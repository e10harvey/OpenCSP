    """Waits up to 'timeout' seconds for all the files to exist.

    Note: there is no guarantee that all files exist when this function completes.
    Rather, this function guarantees that all of the files existed at some point
    during its execution (ie some of the files could have been deleted after
    there existance was verified).

    Arguments:
    ----------
        - files (list[str]): The files to check for the existance of.
        - timeout (float): How many seconds to wait for the given files to exist.
        - alternates (dict[str,list[str]]): Alternate files that can exist in the
            place of the given files. An example use case could be to check if an
            error file was created from a process that we're waiting on the
            output from.

    Returns:
    --------
        - A list of the found files.

    Raises:
    -------
        - TimeoutError: if the timeout triggers and not all files exist yet.
