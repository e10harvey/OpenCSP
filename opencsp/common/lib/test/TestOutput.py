"""
Base class supporting testing routines that generate output, including plots, csv files, etc.

Derived classes will call test routines that write output to an "actual_output" directory, and these 
files will be compared against known-good files in a sibling "expected_output" directory.

Supports both interactive execution and automatic execution via pytest.

        # gainst matching known-good files.  But if the filenames are re-used, we will compare
        # against the wrong content.
        #
        # Previously we attempted to automatically calculate figure numbers using a TestOutput
        # data member, but this failed because there was a problem achieving correct behavior
        # in updating a data member of the TestOutput class when a given test routine exited
        # when running pytest.  (Interactive execution worked fine.)
        #
        # While I didn't solve this, it makes sense since each test should operate independently
        # without needing the output from previous tests.  This is semantically appropriate due
        # to the need for independent test computations (one test should not depend on the output
        # from another test), and also because pytest can be configured so that individual tests
        # run in parallel, making their execution order unpredictable.
        #
        # So automatically generating consecutive figure numbers seems fundamentally flawed,
        # because we cannot guarantee the order of test execution.  But we still need some means
        # of assuring that (a) each figure filename is unique, and (b) filenames are consistent
        # regardless of test execution order.  The solution I chose is to hard-code figure numbers,
        # relying on the calling code to keep them unique.
