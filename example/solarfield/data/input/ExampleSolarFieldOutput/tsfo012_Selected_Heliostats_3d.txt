Selected Heliostats

Caption:
View of a selected range of heliostats, demonstrating different rendering for tracking, face up, and stowed heliostats.

A subset of heliostats selected, so that plot is effectively zoomed in.
Grey heliostat shows mirrored surfaces.
Blue heliostats are tracking.
Cyan heliostats are face up.
Red heliostats are in stow (out of service).
Green heliostats are in a fixed configuration (az=205.0 deg, el=30.0 deg).
